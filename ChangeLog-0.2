	almost ready to start over!

2013-12-14  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	slighly modified test to check if a point belongs to a triangle

2013-12-13  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	linked against libpthreads because the gcc 4.8.2-1 complains otherwise

2013-12-12  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	- documentation
	- misc changes in mesh routines

2013-12-10  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	- spelling in fibonacci example 
	- added functions example to realbook
	- algebraic parser remembers expression strings
	- INCREMENTAL keyword uses said remembered strings instead of pointers to base materials
	- elements associated to a node are pointers instead of indexes
	- separated header from mesh data when writing gmsh post processing files
	- changed the test to see to which element a point belongs to

2013-12-06  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	- removed realbook/version.sh from trunk
	- modified syntax-tex.sh

2013-12-06  gtheler  <gtheler@tecna.com>

	added fibonacci example to the realbook

2013-12-04  gtheler  <gtheler@tecna.com>

	materials can be defined as INCREMENTAL so their properties are added to a previously-defined material (which can be INCREMENTAL itself)

2013-12-02  gtheler  <gtheler@tecna.com>

	if when defining a variable it already exists (and it is not another kind of object), return its pointer without raising an error

2013-12-02  gtheler  <gtheler@tecna.com>

	reviewed how files are opened with instruction FILE

2013-12-01  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

2013-12-01  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	spelling

2013-12-01  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	- added fibonacci and logistic examples
	- updated TODO

2013-12-01  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	GSL examples in the realbook

2013-12-01  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	- added lorenz.was to example subdir
	- added post.c to write post-processing data for meshes

2013-12-01  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	- give a quick-start (lorenz.was) example after successful make
	- fixed a bug in random() that freed the rng object before using it
	- fixed a bug in multimin() that freed the vector x before using it

2013-11-30  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	- removed gaqn.c (until larry writes a genetic optimization library)
	- MESH_POST for post-processing distributions
	- shape functions take gsl vectors as arguments
	- some mesh-code cleanup

2013-11-30  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	- spelling in configure.sh success
	- default integration tolerance increased to 1e-3 to avoid round-
	off errors
	- moved mesh_free() to mesh.c
	- added wasora_get_loadable_routine
	- version data is indented
	- fixed an infinite loop when printing expressions in print_function
	- name in mesh is optional
	- special vector "x_global" whose components are aliases of variables x, y and z
	- check that properties appear only after a mesh
	- misc changes in mesh routines

2013-11-29  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	- do not allow to define properties before meshes
	- limited wasora header md5 mismatch error message to less than MAX_STRING characters

2013-11-29  gtheler  <gtheler@tecna.com>

	integral functional can read maximum number of subintervals as an optional argument

2013-11-29  gtheler  <gtheler@tecna.com>

	- macro wasora_call() to automatically check return code from functions
	- separate wasora version information from plugins' with a random ascii line
	- replaced some functions that return void with ints

2013-11-28  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	redesigned gauss integration over meshes

2013-11-27  gtheler  <gtheler@tecna.com>

	kate and tex syntax highlight generators now look for the src directory in the right place

2013-11-23  jeremy theler  <jeremy@sheila>

	- check for consistency of mesh spatial dimensions
	- mesh structure does not hold finite-element local objects anymore, it should be allocated by the particular plugin
	- minor changes of nomenclature in mesh pointers

2013-11-16  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>

	added versionmajor

2013-11-16  jeremy theler  <jeremy@tom>
